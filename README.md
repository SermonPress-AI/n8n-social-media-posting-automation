# n8n Social Media Posting Automation

Part of the **SermonPressAI** open-source workflow collection, this repository contains **n8n workflows for churches that automatically generate and post sermon announcements to social media**.

When a church uploads its latest sermon, these workflows pull the sermon’s title, passage, description, and link, then format them into multiple ready-to-use post options for platforms like Facebook. Each post is biblically grounded, engaging, and written to encourage viewers to watch the full sermon.

## 📌 Features

* **Automatic Post Generation** – Creates multiple post variations when a new sermon is uploaded.
* **Biblically Rooted Content** – Pulls from the sermon’s text and theme to produce Christ-centered summaries.
* **Custom Formatting** – Includes clickable links to the full sermon and can embed Scripture references.
* **Multi-Platform Ready** – Posts can be sent to Facebook automatically, with options to add Instagram, Twitter/X, and more.
* **Workflow Modularity** – Churches can adapt templates, tone, and formatting to fit their congregation’s style.
* **No Manual Copy/Paste** – Automates repetitive posting tasks while maintaining quality and theological accuracy.
