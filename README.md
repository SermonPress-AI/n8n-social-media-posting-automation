# n8n Social Media Posting Automation

Part of the **SermonPressAI** open-source workflow collection, this repository contains **n8n workflows for churches that automatically generate and post sermon announcements to social media**.

When a church uploads its latest sermon, these workflows pull the sermon‚Äôs title, passage, description, and link, then format them into multiple ready-to-use post options for platforms like Facebook. Each post is biblically grounded, engaging, and written to encourage viewers to watch the full sermon.

 	with the node, you will take the OpenAI key and either use the default prompt given or plug in your own prompt to use 


  * Human-in-the-loop
	Add your own credential by signing into your google account and then change the "to" section to your own email. after you run the node and all of the nodes before it you should get an email where you can approve or deny the information given
